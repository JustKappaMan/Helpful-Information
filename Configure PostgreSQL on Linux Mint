1. Open the file pg_hba.conf. On Ubuntu, it's located in /etc/postgresql/*version*/main. Change this line at the bottom of the file, it should be the first line of the settings:

    local   all             postgres                                peer
to
    local   all             postgres                                trust

Side note: If you want to be able to connect with other users as well, you also need to change:

    local   all             all                                peer
to
    local   all             all                                md5


2. Restart the server:
    $ sudo service postgresql restart
    # Output: * Restarting PostgreSQL database server


3. Login into psql and set your password
    $ psql -U postgres
    db> ALTER USER postgres with password 'your-pass';
    # Output: ALTER ROLE

Side note: If you have other users, they will need a password as well:
    db> ALTER USER my_user with password 'your-pass';

Then enter:
    db> exit


4. Finally change the pg_hba.conf from

    local   all             postgres                                trust
to
    local   all             postgres                                md5


5. Restart the server again:
    $ sudo service postgresql restart
    # Output: * Restarting PostgreSQL database server


6. After restarting the postgresql server, the postgres user accepts the password that you chose:
    $ psql -U postgres
    # Output: Password for user postgres:

And you are in psql:
    postgres=#

Side note: Same now works for my_user if you added the user and password:
    $ psql -d YOUR_DB_NAME -U my_user
    # Which will ask you for the new password of my_user.


Authentication methods details:

* trust - anyone who can connect to the server is authorized to access the database

* peer - use client's operating system user name as database user name to access it.

* md5 - password-base authentication
